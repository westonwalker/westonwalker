There are a couple ways to add custom colors in Tailwind. The fastest way by far is to just add them inline with [ ] brackets...
```html
<p class="text-xl text-[#84C3BE]">This is a custom color!</p>
```
<custom-color></custom-color>

This is true for almost every value in Tailwind. Custom values for background colors, paddings, heights, can be added as well!
